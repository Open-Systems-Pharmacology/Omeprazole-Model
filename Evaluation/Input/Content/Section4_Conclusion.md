The developed PBPK model of omeprazole describes the PK data of S-, R-, and racemat omeprazole in CYP2C19 extensive and poor metabolizers after administrations of single as well as multiple p.o. doses very well.

The assumption for the same distribution model and lipophilicity for R-/S-omeprazole is reasonable, as no i.v. data were available for R-omeprazole.

CYP2C19 expression in gut was reduced according to [Olivares-Morales 2016](#5-References) to better describe R-omeprazole. As CYP2C19 CL and expression are obviously inter-dependent, caution should be used when extrapolating such findings to other CYP2C19 substrates. The impact of the reduced expression of CYP2C19 in gut was therefore investigated for its impact on omeprazole levels.

Comparison of population simulation results with observed data show that the observations were generally within the simulated ranges, both after i.v. and p.o. dosing and for either CYP2C19 EM and PM.
