The presented PBPK model of omeprazole has been developed to be used in a PBPK Drug-Drug-Interactions (DDI) network with omeprazole as a substrate of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 and an inhibitor of CYP2C19.

Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for the treatment of gastric acid related diseases. Omeprazole is administered as a racemic mixture of its two enantiomers, S-omeprazole and R-omeprazole.

The following ADME characteristics for (R-/S-) omeprazole were taken from omeprazole 20 mg capsule [FDA SPC](#5-references):

**Absorption**: Absorption of (R-/S-) omeprazole is rapid, with peak plasma levels occurring approximately 1-2 hours after dose. Absorption of omeprazole takes place in the small intestine and is usually completed within 3-6 hours. The systemic availability (bioavailability) from a single oral dose of omeprazole is approximately 40%. After repeated once-daily administration, the bioavailability increases to about 60%.

**Distribution**: The apparent volume of distribution in healthy subjects is approximately 0.3 l/kg body weight. Omeprazole is 97% plasma protein bound.

**Metabolism**: (R-/S-) Omeprazole is completely metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system (CYP). The major part of its metabolism is dependent on the polymorphically expressed CYP2C19, responsible for the formation of hydroxyomeprazole, the major metabolite in plasma. The remaining part is dependent on another specific isoform, CYP3A4, responsible for the formation of omeprazole sulphone. As a consequence of high affinity of omeprazole to CYP2C19, there is a potential for competitive inhibition and metabolic drug-drug interactions. No metabolite has been found to be pharmacologically active.

**Elimination**: Almost 80% of an oral dose of omeprazole is excreted as metabolites in the urine, the remainder in the faeces, primarily originating from bile secretion.

**Linearity/non-linearity:** The AUC of omeprazole increases with repeated administration following a non-linear dose-AUC relationship. This time- and dose- dependency is due to a decrease of first pass metabolism and systemic clearance probably caused by an inhibition of the CYP2C19 enzyme by omeprazole and/or its metabolites (e.g. the sulphone).

**Stereoselectivity:** Because both enantiomers are substrates and inhibitors of CYP2C19, the PK profile of each enantiomer is expected to differ when the racemic mixture is administered as compared to as a single agent because of mutual inhibition between the enantiomers ([Äbelö 2000](#5-references)). The Ki for R-omeprazole is 2-5 higher compared to S-omeprazole ([Liu 2005](#5-references), [Wu 2014](#5-references)).
